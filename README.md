Hi, I’m Anna

I'm passionate about data analysis and big data. I'm currently undergoing comprehensive training and internship programs to further develop my skills in data analysis.
I'm excited to collaborate on projects that aim to solve real-world problems and make a meaningful impact. If you're working on a project that aligns with my interests and skills, I'd love to join forces and contribute to its success.

Feel free to reach out to me
